![Two New Publications Accepted at MSR 2025](/featured.png)

Over the [last summer we were joined by two US interns](https://sse.cs.tu-dortmund.de/news-list/details/our-summer-interns-43244/) - Vivek Sarkar from University of Washington and Jared Chiaramonte from Arizona State University. Both Vivek and Jared stayed with us for three months, each working on a separate internship project. After the internships ended we kept in touch and wrote papers for both projects. We are happy to report that both these papers have been accepted to the [Data and Tool Showcase Track](https://2025.msrconf.org/track/msr-2025-data-and-tool-showcase-track) of the [Mining Software Repositories Conference 2025](https://2025.msrconf.org/) (MSR '25) in Ottawa, Canada.  
   
 In **"CoPhi - Mining C/C++ Packages for Conan Ecosystem Analysis"** Vivek and his co-authors propose *CoPhi*, a tool that performs large-scale analysis on C/C++ packages in the Conan ecosystem. CoPhi is able to analyze such packages and extracts metrics reflecting relevant program features, including its inheritance chain and call graph structure. Such information can then be used by researchers to build benchmark corpora meeting domain-specific feature requirements.  
   
 Jared and his co-authors published **"MARIN: A Research-Centric Interface for Querying Software Artifacts on Maven Repositories"**. MARIN is a framework for implementing custom large-scale analyses on the Maven Central ecosystem. It enables users to focus entirely on implementing the domain-specific analysis task, while MARIN deals with all infrastructure-related tasks: Iterating software artifacts, aggregating metadata, resolving direct and transitive dependencies, as well as parallelizing and incrementalizing the analysis execution.

Both [CoPhi](https://github.com/sse-labs/delphi-cpp) and [MARIN](https://github.com/sse-labs/marin) are available on GitHub.
