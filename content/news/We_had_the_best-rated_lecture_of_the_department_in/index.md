Our course Typesystems for Correctness and Security received the best rating of the department in the summer term 2021.

Students graded our course on typesystems with an overall rating of 1.19.Â  The course covers the theory, discusses the properties with which type systems assist us in software development, and examines the implementation of current type systems. It takes a pragmatic approach and students practice implementing type checkers during the course of the lecture and exercises.
