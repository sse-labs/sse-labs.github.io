![New Benchmark for Android Taint Analysis](/featured.png)

While some benchmarks based on small self-written example code for Android taint analysis such as DroidBench existed before, there was no benchmark composed out of real-world code. This impeded the reliability of the evaluations in this field as it made them restricted and hard to compare. In this new paper we provided a novel benchmark based on Android malware and a framework to created and evaluate such benchmarks.  The documented taint flow baseline was established through a rigorous process. We evaluate our benchmark and methodology through several experiment involving taint analysis tools and user studies.

The [Empirical Software Engineering journal](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664) is a top publication venue in the field of software systems. With an impact factor of 2.522 and an h5-index of 52 Google Scholar ranks it #6 in the field. We are happy to provide our paper open access under the German DEAL agreement.
