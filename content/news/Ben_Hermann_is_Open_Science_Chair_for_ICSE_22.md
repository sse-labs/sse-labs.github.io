Research output should be publicly and freely accessible by anyone, permanently. Prof. Hermann is responsible for the proliferation and promotion of open science practices at the International Conference on Software Engineering 2022.

As a principle, research should be publicly and freely accessible by anyone, permanently.

The reality, however, is more complicated than this principle. To proliferate and promote open science and to solve complex real-world issues with the aforementioned principle, ICSE nominates an open-science chair since 2021. For the 2022 edition Prof. Hermann was recruited.

The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), is *the* premier software engineering conference. Since 1975, it is a well-recognized annual forum where research, practice, and education in the field of software engineering meet and discuss. With an h5-index of 77 it is the #1 publication venue in the field of software systems accoding to Google Scholar. Prof. Hermann previously served for ICSE as Registration Chair in 2020 - the edition that was rescheduled as a virtual event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
