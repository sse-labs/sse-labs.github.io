He received the prize for his Master thesis in our group on extending PhASAR for Rust

One of our students - **Felix Stegmaier** - received the Hans-Uhde-Prize for his Master thesis titled "*Inter-procedural Static Analysis for Unsafe Rust using PhASAR*". Felix extended PhASAR to accommodate for the differences to C/C++ in compilation in preparation for analysis. He built the groundworks for real-world code analysis and possible applications in program testing or security. He showed significant insight into the scientific method as well as the problem domain.

The Hans Uhde Prize is an annual award presented by the Hans Uhde Foundation to honor outstanding academic achievements in engineering disciplines. Established in 1986 by Dipl.-Ing. Hans Uhde, the foundation aims to promote science, education, and research.

PhASAR is an open-source static analysis framework designed for analyzing C/C++ programs at the LLVM intermediate representation (IR) level. It enables researchers and developers to define and solve various data-flow problems in a fully automated manner. The framework provides essential analyses such as call-graph construction, points-to analysis, and class hierarchy analysis, facilitating the development of inter-procedural analyses. It was developed by Philipp Schubert, Ben Hermann, and Eric Bodden during Prof. Hermann's time at Paderborn University and is now a thriving open-source project with a number of very active contributors outside the original team.
