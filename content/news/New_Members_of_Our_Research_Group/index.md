![New Members of Our Research Group](/featured.png)

Starting in April, our research group nearly doubled in size. Our first new member is [Dr. Dominik Helm](/team/dominik-helm/). Dominik received his doctorate from the Technical University of Darmstadt for his work in modular collaborative program analysis. He is a key contributor to the OPAL framework. He has chosen our research group for his postdoctorate time funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the [Walter Benjamin-Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin). The program provides a full funding for his position for the next two years and provides an excellent start in Dominik's research career. In his project titled *[Systematic Quality Assessment of Static Call-Graph Analyses](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/541346877?language=en)*, Dominik wants to enable developers and users of static program analyses to be able to make educated choices on the quality of call-graph analyses. These analyses are a basic building block in program analysis. They directly influence the precision and efficiency of analyses built on top.

[Andreas Diepenbrock](/team/andreas-diepenbrock/) is starting in our research group as an external doctoral student. Andreas is working at the University of Applied Sciences Dortmund (FH Dortmund). He has a considerable publication record already and works in the field of data privacy. Together with our group he will explore how static program analysis can be used to answer questions in data privacy. The working title of his dissertation project isÂ *Data Protection Impact Assessments of Software Systems by Utilizing Static Code Analysis*.
