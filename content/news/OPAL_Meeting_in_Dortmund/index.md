![OPAL Meeting in Dortmund](/featured.png)

Scientists from TU Darmstadt visit the Secure Software Engineering Group to discuss the future of the OPAL framework. Over two days we discussed joint projects - both scientific and engineering - in relation to OPAL.

[Dominik Helm](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/main_stg/staff_stg/dominik_helm_1.en.jsp), [Dr. Sven Keide](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/main_stg/staff_stg/sven_keidel_1.en.jsp)l, and [Tobias Roth](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/main_stg/staff_stg/tobias_roth_1.en.jsp) from the [Software Technology Group](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/main_stg/index.en.jsp) at Technische Universit√§t Darmtadt visited our group over two days. We discussed the future of the OPAL framework and our joint activities in that area. And of course we celebrated the recent release of OPAL 5.

[OPAL](https://www.opal-project.de/) is a highly-configurable static program analysis framework for JVM languages. It supports Java 19 Bytecode and is written entirely in Scala. Client analyses can thus be also written in any JVM-compatible language.

We were happy to host the second meeting in Dortmund and look forward to our next meeting in Darmstadt in the fall.
