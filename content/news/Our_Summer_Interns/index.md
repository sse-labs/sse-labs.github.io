We welcome our international interns for the summer! Jared Chiaramonte and Vivek Sarkar join our group for the next months.

Again, this year, our PhD students Anemone Kampkötter and Johannes Düsing are supported by two interns from the US over the summer. They applied through the RISE Germany program of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD; German: Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst).

Jared Chiaramonte is an undergraduate student of Computer Science from Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ. During his internship, Jared aims to provide researchers with the tools necessary to easily inspect and study software artifacts. He designs and develops a software library that enables users to traverse software components from the Maven Central Repository, as well as to access metadata and to inspect bytecode. By implementing multiple layers of caching, the library is especially aimed at researchers conducting large-scale empirical studies.

> I applied for the Maven Central interface project because I wanted learn more about the computer science research space, and to get experience working with build tools and static analysis projects. While spending time abroad, I have found the public transit and football culture to be the most surprising.

Vivek Sarkar is an undergraduate student of Computer Science from the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. In his three-month research project at TU Dortmund, Vivek is working on an integrated solution that crawls C/C++ packages from the ConanCenter repository and analyzes them with the static analysis framework PhASAR. This enables researchers and software analysts to traverse software artifacts and analyze them for various properties, perform large-scale empirical studies more easily and extend the testing capabilities of new analyses written in PhASAR.

> The reason why I chose this project was because it would give me the opportunity to learn more about static analysis and LLVM, as well as how to plan and organize a relatively large project. On a less technical note, I also wanted to come because I would get to explore and learn about the culture(s) of Germany and the rest of Continental Europe, which I've never been exposed to before. As a whole, I think this internship will help me grow as a person in more than one way, and I'm extremely thankful for the opportunity to work in this lab.

The RISE Germany program offers summer research internships in Germany for undergraduate students from North America, Great Britain, and Ireland. It is offered by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD; German: Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst). If you want to do your internship with us in Summer 2025, please contact us!
