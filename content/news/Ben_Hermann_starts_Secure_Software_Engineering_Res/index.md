After his substitute professorship for IT security at Paderborn University, Prof. Hermann joins TU Dortmund and starts his research group for Secure Software Engineering. As the name suggest the focus of the group will be on the engineering of secure software. A special emphasis will be given to the evolutionary development of software systems. This will enable software developers to learn better from past mistakes and be warned early in the process.

The second big topic of the research group is quality of science in computer science. We are inspecting and improving peer review processes for software-intensive research.
