Two journal publications from our group were accepted at the Journal-First track at the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Soft­ware Engineering (ICSE). We will present our results to a wide audience at the conference.

The papers [Identifying Challenges for OSS Vulnerability Scanners - A Study & Test Suit](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2021.3101739)e and [TaintBench: Automatic Real-World Malware Benchmarking of Android Taint Analyses](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-021-10013-5) were selected by the program committee to appear at ICSE 2022 in the Journal-First track. We will present our results to a wide audience at the conference - usually around 2,000 researchers convene and discuss latest scientific results.

The Journal-First track is intended to give authors of papers at three top-tier journals (IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), and Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)) the chance to give a presentation at ICSE. This allows authors to interact directly with the community and stimulates productive discussion on the results.

The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Soft­ware Engineering (ICSE), is *the* premier software engineering con­fe­rence. Since 1975, it is a well-recognized annual forum where re­search, practice, and education in the field of software engineering meet and discuss. With an h5-index of 77 it is the #1 publication venue in the field of software systems accoding to Google Scholar. Prof. Hermann [currently serves as Open Science chair for the conference](/newsdetail/news/ben-hermann-is-open-science-chair-for-icse22-12837/) and previously served for ICSE as Registration Chair in 2020 - the edition that was rescheduled as a virtual event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
