![OPAL Research Meeting in Darmstadt](/featured.png)

In our regular interval we met with researcher from the [Software Technology Group](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/) at [Technische Universität Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/). As both our groups are involved in the development of the [OPAL framework](https://www.opal-project.de/) we have an in-person meeting roughly every six months to catch up with the other groups work.

OPAL is a highly-configurable static program analysis framework for JVM languages. It supports Java 19 Bytecode and is written entirely in Scala. Client analyses can thus be also written in any JVM-compatible language.

We had two amazing day in Darmstadt discussing our current and future research ideas as well as ongoing work to improve the OPAL framework. Some great ideas for a version 6 of OPAL were drafted, but we have no release date for this yet. Also, the Darmstadt people and us had a lot of fun exploring the city in perfect weather.
