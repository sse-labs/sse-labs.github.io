Project SPEAR wins 2nd place at the university challenge for excellent young research!

It started out with a rough idea: What if we could predict how much energy we would need to execute a program before we do? Maximilian Krebs examined this question in his Bachelor thesis. After completion he continued on that quest and together with the Secure Software Engineering research group extended the SPEAR approach. Now it is a working Visual Studio Code plugin that makes developers aware of the potential energy cost on a per line basis.

[We entered SPEAR into the university challenge for excellent young research and won 2nd prize for 2025.](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/nachrichtendetail/innovative-ideen-zur-energiewende-und-zum-klimaschutz-ausgezeichnet-52155/) This years topic was *energy and climate - together for the future*. Â Max presented it very well with a project pitch during the selection event. We are immensely excited that this very new project already got that degree of recognition.

Together, we will continue on that road and make SPEAR even more precise, robust, and portable over the next years. Stay with us or even better be a part of it!

And if you say, you heard that name and an award before... you are right. SPEAR also won:

* [The sustainability award of the department](//newsdetail/spear-wins-the-sustainability-award-of-our-department-50879/)
* [The thesis award at the GI-SE conference 2024](//newsdetail/gi-se-2024-39871/)
