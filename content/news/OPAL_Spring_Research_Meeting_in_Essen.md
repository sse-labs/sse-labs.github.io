Our group met with researchers involved in the OPAL project again.

Our research group visits Interim Professor [Dr. Dominik Helm](https://sse.uni-due.de/ueber-uns/team/dr-dominik-helm) at University of Duisburg-Essen (UDE). He was so kind to host the OPAL Research Spring Meeting this year.

In a regular interval we meet with researcher from the [Software Technology Group](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/)] at [Technische Universität Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/) and other researchers contributing and/or using the [OPAL framework](https://www.opal-project.de/). We have an in-person meeting roughly every six months to catch up with everybody.

OPAL is a highly-configurable static program analysis framework for JVM languages. It supports Java 21 Bytecode and is written entirely in Scala. Client analyses can thus be also written in any JVM-compatible language.

We had two exciting days in Essen discussing our current and future research ideas as well as ongoing work to improve the OPAL framework. This year [Michael Eichberg](https://www.michael-eichberg.de/) joined us as well. Also, [Michael Schlichtig](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/person/32312) and [Markus Schmidt](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/person/29297) from [Heinz-Nixdorf-Insitute / Paderborn University](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/sse) gave a remote talk on upcoming OPAL integration into Boomerang.
