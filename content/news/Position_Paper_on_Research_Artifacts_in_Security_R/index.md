![Position Paper on Research Artifacts in Security Research Published](/featured.png)

While artifact sharing is now an established practice in many part of computer science research, its adoption in the security community is still in lower than in other fields. This of course has several reasons which we reflect in this position paper in the IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine. We also make several suggestions to mitigate these issues in order to allow more artifact sharing in security research. This will overall benefit the community as a whole - so not only the research community but also industry and open-source communities.

IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine is publication of the IEEE Computer and Reliability Societies. It has a vast readership in the scientific community and in the industry.
