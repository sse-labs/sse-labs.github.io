Our research group visits the Secure Software Engineering group at Paderborn University led by Prof. Dr. Eric Bodden.

We spent two days in Paderborn at the [Heinz-Nixdorf-Institute](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/) - the home of the [Secure Software Engineering group](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/sse/) at [Paderborn University](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/). Our goals were to catch up on each others research and to identify new areas to collaborate. Both groups work on static program analysis and software ecosystem security. In ongoing work, we collaborate on the development of the [PhASAR](https://phasar.org/) platform currently making it ready for Rust. It was a good opportunity to synchronize our activities in this and other areas.

[Johannes Düsing](/team/johannes-duesing/) gave a talk on *Persisting and Reusing Results of Static Program Analyses* on a Large Scale as a sneak preview of [his upcoming paper at ASE'23](/newsdetail/paper-on-modular-static-analyses-published-at-ase-23-33995/). [Ben Hermann](/team/ben-hermann/) presented a part of our groups current research agenda in a talk titled *Challenges in Statically Analyzing Complete Software Ecosystems*.

The Secure Software Engineering group in Paderborn develops languages, mechnisms, processes, and tools to allow software developers to express security requirements and have effective mechanisms to enforce them. Their expertise in static program analysis is documented by numerous publications on that topic. They are also a group of very nice and welcoming people and we enjoyed our visit with them very much!
