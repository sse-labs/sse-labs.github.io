Our paper "Lossless, Persisted Summarization of Static Callgraph, Points-To and Data-Flow Analysis" will be presented at ECOOP'21.

In this paper we present an approach to significantly speed up whole-program analysis (WPA) using compositionality and modularity of the analyes and their respective results. It works on every level: callgraph, points-to and data-flow analysis. We built this on top of PhASAR so you can easily add it to your PhASAR-based client analyses. As usual with PhASAR this works with real-world code out of the box.

This paper is part of the fruitful collaboration of the Secure Software Engineering Groups at [Paderborn University](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/sse/) and TU Dortmund. A replication package will be made available after it passed artifact evaluation at ECOOP.

ECOOP is Europe’s longest-standing annual Programming Languages conference (since 1987!). It covers all topics related to programming languages, software development, object-oriented technologies, systems and applications.  The 2021 issue was supposed to happen in Aarhus, Denmark, but now is held as an online event together with ISSTA 2021.
