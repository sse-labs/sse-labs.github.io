Starting in 1987, ECOOP is Europe’s oldest programming conference. That summer, at the Palais des Congres in Paris, the conference aimed to promote an up-and-coming new software paradigm, *object-oriented programming*.

In the following years, what was at first a heretical attempt to redefine how we approach programming gradually took over the software world, and, over time, ECOOP slowly broadened in scope to accept a larger variety of papers.

The 2022 edition of ECOOP will be happening in Berlin and will be organized by Mira Mezini (TU Darmstadt) and Ben Hermann (TU Dortmund). The five-day program will be packed with workshops and sessions highlighting all aspects of programming. The community is looking forward to meeting in person again and ECOOP will provide the proper setting for that.
