Till Schallau received funding in the prestigious [Software Campus](https://softwarecampus.de/) program of the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF). This is a high-profile program that only selects a few of the PhD students in computer science in Germany each year. Its goal is twofold: Educate and develop the next IT leaders in Germany and fund a research project in collaboration with an industry partner.

Till's project *VeRBAL: Vehicle Requirements Specification and Behavior Analysis Language*Â will be academically supervised by Prof. Dr. Hermann. The project will be conducted in close collaboration with Volkswagen AG as an industry partner. The project's goal is to develop a domain-specific tool to support domain experts to create and maintain formal specifications and requirements in scenario-based testing for autonomic driving.

The funding allows Till to manage his own research team for the project and acquire management experience and expertise. Till is the first doctoral student from TU Dortmund that is funded in the program.
