Our study "Community Expectations for Research Artifacts and Evaluation Processes" has won the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award!

Replicability in computer science research is essential to advance the field and to establish trust in the acquired results. One way to encourage it is by peer review in artifact evaluation.

Artifact evaluation has been introduced into the software engineering and programming languages research community with a pilot at ESEC/FSE 2011 and has since then enjoyed a healthy adoption throughout the conference landscape. In this qualitative study, we examined the expectations of the community toward research artifacts and their evaluation processes.

For this paper we won the prestigious [ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award](https://www.sigsoft.org/awards/distinguishedPaperAward.html). This prize is awarded annually by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) only for the best papers each year.
