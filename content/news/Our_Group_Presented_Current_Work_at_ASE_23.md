We had two presentations at Automated Software Engineering Conference in Luxembourg. Our work on reusing partial results for static program analysis has been greatly received and inspired many discussions.

September turned out to be a busy travel month for us. After our research visits in [Paderborn](/newsdetail/ssetudo-visits-sseupb-34605/) and [Darmstadt](/newsdetail/ssetudo-visits-stgtuda-34771/) we traveled to Luxembourg for the [38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2023)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ase-2023). We could present our recent work and form new connections with various international colleagues.

[Anemone Kampkötter](/team/anemone-kampkoetter/) presented her Ph.D. project on the handling of unsound programming structures in static program analysis in the doctoral forum. In her work, she aims to defer the final decision in a static program analysis to the execution of the program. This would enable static analysis developers to protect executables even in the case that the program uses dynamic programming language constructs.

[Johannes Düsing](/team/johannes-duesing/) presented our paper "Persisting and Reusing Results of Static Program Analyses on a Large Scale" in the Code Change Analysis session at the main conference. In this paper, we propose and present an infrastructure and method to reuse partial or intermediate results from static program analysis much like a software ecosystem. We show that this is not only useful for static program analysis but can also benefit empirical studies on software ecosystems and repositories. It is our first step towards actual ecosystem-scale analysis and a cornerstone of our research strategy.

The Automated Software Engineering conference series is a long-standing venue maintained by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group in Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT). It has been ranked as an A\* conference (highest possible rank) in CORE ranking since 2021 (ranked A before) and is currently at position 8 in the Google Scholar Metrics for the Software Systems category with an h5-index of 50 and an h5-median of 81. This year's organization provided an exceptional forum for international research with great opportunities to connect to other researchers in an impressive setting - the EU Council uses the same rooms.
