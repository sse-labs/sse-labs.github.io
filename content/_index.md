We are the [Secure Software Engineering Group at TU Dortmund](https://sse.cs.tu-dortmund.de), led by [Prof. Ben Hermann](https://benhermann.eu). Our research lies at the crossroad of software engineering, programming languages and security â€” developing **static analysis methods** to detect vulnerabilities, assess risks across **large-scale software ecosystems** and **library dependencies**, enforce security through type systems, and advance **reproducibility and research quality** in computer science.
